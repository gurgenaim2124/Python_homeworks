1. Conditional Statements
    Create a Python script that implements a simple banking application:
    Define a variable for account balance
    Define a variable for withdrawal amount
    Use if-else statements to check if the withdrawal is possible
    If the withdrawal amount is less than or equal to the balance, print "Withdrawal successful" and show the remaining balance
    If the withdrawal amount exceeds the balance, print "Insufficient funds" and show the current balance
    Reference the approach shown in conditionals.py and conditionals_2.py

2. Grade Classification
    Write a script that assigns letter grades based on a numeric score (0-100):
    90-100: A
    80-89: B
    70-79: C
    60-69: D
    Below 60: F
    Use elif chains similar to those in chain.py
    Include appropriate messages for each grade category

3. Ternary Operators
    Create a script that uses ternary operators for at least two different scenarios:
    Check if a number is even or odd
    Check if a person is eligible to vote (age >= 18)
    Determine if a temperature is above or below freezing
    Format your output clearly as shown in ternary.py

4. Basic For Loops
    Write a script that calculates the squares of numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop
    Print each number and its square in a readable format
    Reference the patterns in for_loop_basics.py

5. Range Function
    Create a script that demonstrates three different ways of using the range function:
    Print all numbers from 1 to 20
    Print all even numbers from 2 to 20
    Print all numbers from 20 to 1 (counting down)
    Use the techniques shown in range.py

6. String Iteration
    Write a script that accepts a word from the user and:
    Prints each character on a separate line
    Counts the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the word
    Prints the word in reverse order
    Reference the approach in strings.py (from the loops directory)
    
7. Using Enumerate
    Create a script that uses the enumerate function to work with a list of items:
    Create a list of at least 5 fruits or other items
    Use enumerate to print each item with its position (index + 1)
    Use conditional logic to mark even-positioned items differently
    Base your approach on enumerate.py
